# Requirements & Features

## System Requirements

1. **API Server**
   - FastAPI-based web server
   - RESTful API endpoints for PDF and image processing
   - Error handling and validation

2. **Processing Engine**
   - PDF parsing and conversion to markdown
   - OCR capability for scanned documents
   - Image processing with text extraction
   - Caching mechanism for improved performance

3. **Deployment**
   - Docker containerization
   - Environment configuration
   - Resource management

## Feature Descriptions

### 1. PDF to Markdown Conversion

The system must convert PDF documents to markdown format, preserving:
- Text content and formatting
- Document structure (headings, paragraphs)
- Lists and tables (when possible)
- Links and references

### 2. Image Processing

The system must process images to extract text:
- Support common image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP)
- Apply OCR to extract text content
- Convert extracted text to markdown format
- Detect image files by extension

### 3. URL-based Processing

The system must support processing files via URL:
- Download PDF or image files from provided URLs
- Apply appropriate processing based on file type
- Handle download errors gracefully

### 4. Embedded Image Processing

The system must process images embedded in PDFs:
- Extract images from PDF documents
- Apply OCR to extract text from images
- Include extracted text in the markdown output
- Toggle this feature with a parameter

## Business Rules

1. Either a file upload or URL must be provided for processing
2. File type detection should be based on file extension
3. Processing should be aborted if neither file nor URL is provided
4. Appropriate error messages should be returned for invalid inputs
5. Large files should be handled efficiently

## Edge Cases

1. **Corrupted Files**: System should handle corrupted PDF or image files gracefully
2. **Complex Layouts**: System should attempt to preserve complex document layouts
3. **Mixed Content**: PDFs with both text and images should be processed appropriately
4. **Large Files**: System should handle large files without excessive resource consumption
5. **Unsupported Formats**: System should reject unsupported file formats with clear error messages
6. **Network Issues**: System should handle URL download failures gracefully
