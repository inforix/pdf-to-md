# PDF to Markdown Service Overview

## Background

The PDF to Markdown service is designed to convert PDF documents and images to markdown format, making it easier to work with content from these formats in markdown-compatible environments. The service leverages OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to extract text from scanned documents and images.

## Core Vision

To provide a simple, reliable API for converting PDF documents and images to well-formatted markdown, preserving the structure and content of the original documents while making them more accessible and editable.

## Main Goals

1. **Seamless Conversion**: Convert PDF documents to markdown with high fidelity
2. **Image Processing**: Extract text from images using OCR technology
3. **Flexibility**: Support both file uploads and URL-based processing
4. **Efficiency**: Provide fast and reliable conversion with caching mechanisms
5. **Accessibility**: Make content from PDFs and images more accessible and editable

## Problems Solved

1. **Content Extraction**: Extracting text content from PDFs and images can be challenging, especially for scanned documents
2. **Format Conversion**: Converting PDFs to markdown while preserving structure is complex
3. **OCR Integration**: Integrating OCR technology for text extraction from images requires specialized knowledge
4. **API Accessibility**: Providing a simple API for these complex operations makes them accessible to developers

The service uses the MinerU package for PDF processing and OCR, with FastAPI for the web server implementation and Docker for deployment.
